# - Find boost libraries

# This module defines
#  BOOST_INCLUDE_DIR, location of boost headers
#  BOOST_LIBRARY_DIR, location of boost libraries
#  BOOST_XXX_LIBRARY, the library to link against BOOST_XXX lib

# also defined, but not for general use are
#  BOOST_LIBRARY_SUFFIX, suffix to try for finding the boost libraries (unix only)
